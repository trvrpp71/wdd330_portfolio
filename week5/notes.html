            <h1>Testing & Debugging</h1>
            <p>
                Errors typically caused by 1 of 3 things:
                system error: problem with the system or external devices
                programming error: program contains syntax errors or faulty logic
                user error: the user entered data incorrectly and the progam cannot handle it

                It's up to the programmer to minimize program and user error issues through
            </p>
                <h2>Exceptions</h2>
                <p>
                    An exception is an error that produced a return value 
                    that can be used by the program to deal with the error
                    example: calling a function that doesn't exist
                </p>
                <h3>Stack Traces</h3>
                <p>this is the sequence or functions or method calls that lead to the 
                    point of the error occurance.
                </p>
                <h2>Warnings</h2>
                <p>A warning can occur if there is an error but it is not sufficient enought
                    to cause the program to stop executing
                </p>

                <h2>Strict Mode</h2>
                <p>produced more exceptions and warning and prohibits some depreciated features.
                    Used to eliminate "poor" style

                    simply put 'use strict' at the start of a js file to turn on.
                    can use strict mode inside functions for that function only.
                </p>

                <h2>Linting Tools</h2>
                <p>are 3rd party apps that can be used to test code.
                    JS Lint, JS Hint, ES Lint are examples.
                    </p>

                <h2>Feature Detection</h2>
                <p>API's are in a constant state of change with new ones being added all the time.
                    In order to be sure a browser is compatibile with a feature check whether or not
                    a method or object exists before trying to call the method.

                    Old school way was done via browser sniffing using the window.navigator.useragent property, but is no longer recommended.
                </p>

                <h2>Debugging in a browser</h2>
                <h3>Alerts</h3>
                <p>most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog
                    as needed in the code. It stops teh program from running until acknowleged so acts as breakpoints.
                    Alerts can be used to dynamically ensure users are putting hte right data into the program.

                </p>
                <h3>using the Console</h3>
                <p>Most browsers have a development mode which allows users to see the code as it's running.
                    console.log is an example of using the console to output results within a program.
                </p>
                <h3>debugging tools</h3>
                <p>modern browsers will allow the user to set breakpoints in the code to pause it and evaluate the program as it steps through each command.
                    the "debugger" keyword command is a very useful command to know as it will create a breakpoint
                    in the code to stop it executing and see where things are at.
                </p>
                <h2>Error Objects</h2>
                <p>can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs or can be created by a constructor function
                    There are 7 error objects used for specific errors:
                    <li>evalerror: not used in current specs</li>
                    <li>RangeError: when a number is outside of a range limit</li>
                    <li>ReferenceError: thrown when a ref is made to an item that doesn't exist</li>
                    <li>SyntaxError: something is wrong in the syntax</li>
                    <li>TypeError: an error in the type of value used; ie a string instead of a number</li>
                    <li>URIError: problems when encoding or decoding the URI</li>
                    <li>InternalError: non-standard error that occurs in the JS engine.</li>
                </p>
                <p>error objects have properties, but should only use "name", "message", and "stack" properties.</p>

                <h2>Throwing Exceptions</h2>
                <p>it's possible to thow your own exceptions when using the throw statement.
                    throw can be applied to any JS expression causing the program to stop.
                    Best practice is to throw an error object which then can be caught in a catch block.
                </p>
                <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
                <p>by handling exceptions in the program, often errors can be managed without shutting the program down
                    keeping them transparent to the user.
                </p>
                <p> this can be done using hte try, catch and finally </p>

                <h2>Tests</h2>
                <p>testing is an important part of programming. Testing can be as simple as a function that tests the code 
                </p>
                <h3>Test-driven Development</h3>
                <p>TDD is teh process of wrting tests before any code. Then write code to pass the tests. Once that's done, refactor the code and remove repition.
                    Repeat the process until the code is streamlined.
                </p>
                <h3>Testing Frameworks</h3>
                <p>applications that provide a structure to write meaninful tests and then run them.
                    JEST is one of those frameworks.
